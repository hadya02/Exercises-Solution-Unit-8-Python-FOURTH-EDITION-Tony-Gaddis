Average Number of Words
If you have downloaded the source code from the Premium Companion Website you will
find a file named text.txt in the Chapter 08 folder. The text that is in the file is stored
as one sentence per line. Write a program that reads the file’s contents and calculates the
average number of words per sentence.


def main():
    txt=open("text.txt","r")
    lines_count,word_count=0,0
    for line in txt:
        line=line.rstrip("\n").split(" ")
        print(line)
        for word in line:
            word_count+=1
        lines_count+=1
    print("the averge number of words per sentence:",word_count/lines_count)
main()
