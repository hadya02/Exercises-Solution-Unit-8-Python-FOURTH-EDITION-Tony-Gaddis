 Character Analysis
If you have downloaded the source code you will find a file named text.txt in the Chapter 08
folder. Write a program that reads the file’s contents and determines the following:
• The number of uppercase letters in the file
• The number of lowercase letters in the file
• The number of digits in the file
• The number of whitespace characters in the file

def main():
    file=open("text.txt","r")
    contents,uper,lower,space,digits=[],0,0,0,0
    for l in file:
        contents.append(l.rstrip("\n"))
    for line in contents:
        for ch in line:
            if ch.islower():
                lower+=1
            if ch.isuper:
                uper+=1
            if ch.isdigit():
                digits+=1
            if ch.isspace():
                space+=1
    print("upper cases:",uper)
    print("lower cases:",lower)
    print("digits :",digits)
    print("space:",space)
